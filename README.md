Alarm Clock with DS1302 RTC

This code is designed to work with various components, including the DS1302 RTC module, a 4x4 keypad, an LCD with I2C interface, an Arduino board, and a buzzer. 
The main objective of the project is to allow the user to set the RTC module's date and time using the keypad. The current date and time are displayed on the LCD screen. 
Additionally, an alarm can be set, and when the alarm time is reached, the buzzer will sound and a "Get up!!!" message will be displayed on the LCD screen. 
The code includes setup functions for both the date and time and the alarm settings, and it utilizes libraries for the respective components.
